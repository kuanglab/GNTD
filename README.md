# GNTD
Graph-guided Neural Tensor Decomposition (GNTD) is program for reconstructing whole spatial transcriptomes from spatial gene expression profiling data such as the dataets generated by Visium ST and Stereo-seq. GNTD employs tensor structures and formulations to explicitly model the high-order spatial gene expression data with a hierarchical nonlinear decomposition in a three-layer neural network, enhanced by spatial relations among the capture spots and gene functional relations (in protein-protein interaction networks) for accurate reconstruction from highly sparse spatial profiling data.

Data preparation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Spatial Transcriptomics Data
Download Visium spatial transcriptomics data from [10x Genomics](https://support.10xgenomics.com/spatial-gene-expression/datasets/) or [spatialLIBD](http://research.libd.org/spatialLIBD/) and make sure these data are organized in the following structure:

        . <data-folder>
        ├── ...
        ├── <tissue-folder>
        │   ├── filtered_feature_bc_matrix
        │   │   ├── barcodes.tsv.gz
        │   │   ├── features.tsv.gz
        │   │   └── matrix.mtx.gz
        │   ├── spatial
        │   │   └── tissue_positions_list.csv
        └── ...
        
Getting started
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```python
from GNTD import GNTD
from preprocessing import preprocessing

raw_data_path = "<data-folder>/<tissue-folder>"
PPI_data_path = "<BioGRID-PPI> #tab3 file format, please see details in the link: https://wiki.thebiogrid.org/doku.php/biogrid_tab_version_3.0

rank = 128 # tensor rank
l = 0.1 # weight on graph regularization

expr_tensor, A_g, A_xy, ensembl_ids, gene_names, mapping = preprocessing(raw_data_path, PPI_data_path)
model = GNTD(expr_tensor, A_g, A_xy, rank, l)
expr_tensor_hat = model.impute()
```
